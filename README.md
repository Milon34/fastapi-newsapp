##How to Generate Access Tokens and Use Secured Endpoints

You can generate access tokens by hitting the /tokens endpoint in your FastAPI application.

- Open the Swagger UI for your FastAPI application. It is usually available at http://localhost:8000/docs (or another port if you have configured it differently).

- In the Swagger UI, find the /tokens endpoint.

- Click on the POST method for /tokens.

- Provide the required credentials (such as client ID and client secret) in the input fields. These credentials will be used to generate the access token.

- Click on the Execute button to generate the token.

- The response will contain the access token which is needed for authenticated requests.

After generating the access token, you need to include it in the request headers to access any secured endpoints.

- In Swagger, you can use the Authorization header to pass the token for subsequent requests.

- For example, when calling the GET /news endpoint:

- Click on the GET method for /news.

- In the Authorization field, add the token in the following format:
```
Bearer <your_access_token>
```
- Alternatively, you can also manually include the token in the header (e.g., using curl, Postman, or in your code).
